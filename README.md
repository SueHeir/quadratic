## Random Features I think would be good for this application
- [x] Live Cells: they update every 60 seconds (refetch API data, think live stock data, have not implimented picking a time)
- [ ] Cyclic Cell Detection and handling: excel gives you are error, currently is a bug in your code, it should be a feature! (where you pick how fast it updates)
- [ ] Vector Cells (or Python Object Cells): would make working with python easier
- [ ] UI in Cells: buttons, checkboxes, etc.. For changing logic in the sheet or running parts of the code you don't want to auto-update
- [ ] Exportable Application: Export sheet as a non-editable application. People at work can make complicated data-analysis tools and give them to their co-workers who just need to know how to fill it out, press buttons, etc. 
- [ ] Exportable Command Line Script: Export sheet as a compiled executable for data scientist. This is just practical for anyone that currently only uses code to do their work.
